## Rapid EDA
This file, along with others, is part of a series I'm calling Rapid EDA. These Rapid EDAs are 1 hour long exploratory data analyses where I take a dataset and do as much as I can within an hour.
These EDA's are part of the Flatiron school program, as such a lot of these will be done with in the class setting. Along with that, included are Rapid EDA's that I've done on my own time with a dataset that I was slightly interested in
